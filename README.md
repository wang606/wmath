# introduction
'wmath' is a simple mathematical package designed by a bored undergraduate who wants to review math and python at the same time.
## features:
- wmath use a class called '**Meta**' to manage the global meta information, which is not allowed to be instantiated
- wmath has its own class **Fraction** as one of its basic data types
- param '**_new**' is a bool data, included in many methods in wmath, that decides whether to return a brand-new data or apply change on {self}
## modules
wmath contains the following modules: 
- meta.py ------ manage the global meta information
- number_theory.py ------ handling number theory problems in math
- fraction.py ------ the operation in fraction
- paradigm.py ------ the basic class of paradigm classes
- polynomial.py ------ the related problems in polynomial
- matrix.py ------ the problems related to matrix in the rational number field

## meta.py
### Constant
```markdown
(class)
define a constant class.
you can create your own constant container by just instantiate this class.
for example: `a = Constant()`
then you can add constants under it, such as `a.NAME = 'a'`
after that, you can't change the value of a.NAME. 
    __setattr__(self, key, value)
```
### Meta
```markdown
(class)
define Meta information in math.

    *** it's strongly discouraged to instantiate this class. Meta information is expected to be uniform. ***

    # basic information
    Meta use class Constant() as its middle nodes' type,
    and Meta's end node is usually a constant data or a lambda expression or a small function.
    the general structure of Meta usually looks like this:
    Meta:
        |- CONST:
            |- PI: (float) 3.141592653589793
            |- E: (float) 2.718281828459045
            |- ...
        |- GET:
            |- ONE:
                |- int: (lambda) x: 1
                |- float: (lambda) x: 1.0
                |- complex: (lambda) x: 1 + 0j
                |- ...
            |- ZERO:
                |- int: (lambda) x: 0
                |- float: (lambda) x: 0.0
                |- complex: (lambda) x: 0 + 0j
                |- ...
            |- ...
        |- DETERMINE:
            |- {introduced as below}

    as above, Meta has three basic elements: CONST, GET, DETERMINE.
    CONST is used to store consistent constant in math, such as PI, E.
    GET is used to define terms in different class/type/field, such as ONE, ZERO.
    DETERMINE is used to determine if a variant is the specific value/term in specific class/type/field
    *** it's discouraged to add another basic elements unless you know well. ***

    # CONST
    if you want to add your own consistent constants, use CONST please. the statement looks like this:
    `Meta.CONST.YOUR_CONSTANT_NAME = 348236` (348236 is just a example <_<)

    # GET
    if you want to add another terms or classes under Meta.GET, please use the Constant() instantiation.
    *** classification by terms is encouraged ! ***

        for example, if you want to add a MAX as a term, you should use the following statement:
        `Meta.GET.MAX = Constant()`
        and then add its value in different class/type/field, such as:
        *** make sure the class name is correct ! ***
        `Meta.GET.MAX.int = lambda x: 999999999` (of course, it's just an example >_<)
        then you can use function `get_meta(item, _term: str, _class: type = None)` to access this value.

        alternatively, you can classify things by class/type/field, though it's not encouraged, such as:
        `Meta.YOUR_CLASS_NAME = Constant()`
        and then add its various values of different terms, such as:
        *** keep case consistent before and after ***
        `Meta.GET.YOUR_CLASS_NAME.ZERO = lambda x: YOUR_CLASS_NAME(0, x)`

    # DETERMINE
    usually, this node is not your concern.
    but if you want to specify the behavior of function `determine_meta(item, _term: str, _class: type = None)`,
    where the param {_class} or the type of param {item} is your interest class/type/field,
    you can define the value of `Meta.DETERMINE.{{term}}.{{class/type/field}}` or
    `Meta.DETERMINE.{{class/type/field}}.{{term}}`, which is usually a small function.
    by default, the function `determine_meta(item, _term: str, _class: type = None)` would return whether {item}
    is equal to `get_meta(item, _term: str, _class: type = None)`.

        for example, in class Fraction, where Meta.GET.ONE.Fraction = lambda x: Fraction(1), determine_meta(
        Fraction(2), 'ONE') is False while determine_meta(Fraction(1), 'ONE') is True.

    be careful !!!
    once the special value under your term or class is defined, it couldn't be modified,
    unless you instantiate a Constant() again.
    for example, you couldn't use `Meta.GET.MAX.int = lambda x: 100000000` after
    you had stated `Meta.GET.MAX.int = lambda x: 999999999`.
    but you could use `Meta.GET.MAX = Constant()` to redefine the Meta.GET.MAX,
    that would clear up all values of the old one.

    it's designed to protect the Meta information.
        
    __setattr__(self, key, value)
```
- CONST
  - CONST.PI = 3.141592653589793
  - CONST.E = 2.718281828459045
- GET
  - GET.ONE = Constant()
  - GET.ZERO = Constant()

- get_meta(item: object, _term: str, _class: type = None)
```markdown
(function)
get the meta information of {{_term}} in {{_class}} or type(item) if {{_class}} is None.
*** pay attention! this function would check terms first. ***

    :param _term: (str) specify the term
    :param _class: (type) specify the class/type/field

```
- determine(item, _term: str, _class: type = None)
```markdown
(function)
if _class is not None:
    determine if {item} is the '{_term}' in class {_class}.
else:
    determine if {item} is the '{_term}' in class {item} belongs to.
*** pay attention! this function would check terms first. ***
for example: when Meta.GET.ONE.int(x) = 2 and Meta.GET.int.ONE(x) = 1, if the parameters is
(item = 1,  _term = 'ONE', _class = int or None), the result would be False,
since Meta.ONE.int() exists and is not equal to item.
    :param item: (any)
    :param _term: (str) specific term in class/type/field, such as ONE, ZERO, MAX, so on
    :param _class: (type) if you want to specify a specific class/type/field, use this parameter
